# Lover
Lover is a open source command line build system and runner for [Love2D](https://love2d.org) projects inspired by Cargo.

## Features
### Default environment variables
You can access certain constants like the game's version by the use of `os.getenv()`.
```lua
local version = os.getenv("LOVER_PKG_VERSION")
```
[learn more](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/lover/wiki/Constants)

### Easy cross-platform building
You can easily build your game for all supported platforms with a single command.

`lover build <platform>...`

Example:
```
lover build linux
```
```
lover build win32 win64 linux
```

### Automatic dependency management
Love binaries required for building are downloaded automatically and can easily be managed by using Lover commands.

- `lover install <name>` to install
- `lover uninstall <name>` to remove
- `lover dep <name>` to get details
- `lover dep` to list

Example:
```
lover install love-win64
```

## Supported platforms
- ‚úÖ **Full support**: The platform is fully supported and should work. Treated with the highest priority
- üü° **Partial support**: The platform mostly works but you may encounter issues
- üìÅ **Planned**: Support will be implemented in future
- ‚≠ï **Not yet needed**: The platform is not widely used. If you want support for it [you can open an issue](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/lover/issues/new).
- ‚ùó **Testers/maintainers needed**: someone is needed to test and/or maintain the platform
- ‚ùå **Impossible**: The platform is currently impossible to implement

## Why?
I wanted to create a simple expandable and universal system for building, running and managing Love2D projects.

This is a replacement for my previous project [Love2D Universal](https://github.com/Wolfyxon/love2d-universal) which utilized a single Makefile, however a global system-wide tool written in a more advanced language like Rust is a way better approach.
A single script setup for a large project is not a good idea, as organization is not great for such big scripts and implementing a lot of advanced features is not easy. 
Also this tool does not require installing as much software as Love2D Universal and has nice error handling and warnings.

This tool is also very similar to [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/) which manages Rust projects.

## Compiling
Lover is written in **Rust** and managed by **Cargo**. 

Install Cargo on your system then open the terminal in the Lover's source directory and run:
```
cargo build
```
or
```
cargo run
```
to just run it.

Read [the documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) for more info.
